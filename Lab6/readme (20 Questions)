Project: 20 Questions
Rational: This was a java-based school project that I was tasked with.

To use: Compile QuestionMain.java, UserInterface.java, QuestionTree.java, and QuestionNode.java. Run QuestionMain.java; interactions will take place via console.
Note: All necessary files must all exist within the same folder. QuestionMain.java and UserInterface.java were provided by the instructor. 



Instructions: "Implement a yes/no guessing game called "20 Questions." Each round of the game begins by
you (the human player) thinking of an object. The computer will try to guess your object by asking you a series of yes or
no questions. Eventually the computer will have asked enough questions that it thinks it knows what object you are
thinking of. It will make a guess about what your object is. If this guess is correct, the computer wins; if not, you win.
The computer keeps track of a binary tree whose nodes represent questions and answers. (Every node's data is a string
representing the text of the question or answer.) A "question" node contains a left "yes" subtree and a right "no" subtree.
An "answer" node is a leaf. The idea is that this tree can be traversed to ask the human player a series of questions.
(Though the game is called "20 Questions," our game will not limit the tree to a height of 20. Any height is allowed.)"
