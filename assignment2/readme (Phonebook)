Project: Phonebook
Rational: This was a java-based school project that I was tasked with.

To use: Compile Test.java, PhonebookManager.java, and ListNode.java. Run PhonebookManager.java; interactions will take place via console.
Note: All necessary files must all exist within the same folder.



Instructions: "This program focuses on implementing a single linked list.  Turn in at least 2 files (classes).  You are welcome to add additional classes as you see fit. I prefer three; a ListNode, PhonebookManager, and a TestClass (with the main() method).

Note that you will not be using Java's LinkedList class but making your own.

The phone book node should contain at least first name, last name, address, city, and phone number fields in the phonebook node.

The phonebook manager will allow you to either add an entry at the beginning, middle, or end of the node (name, address, city, phone #), as well as delete, and modify the fields. Finally, you should be able to print out your list in a nice format."
