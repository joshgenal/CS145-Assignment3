Project: Word Search
Rational: This was a java-based school project that I was tasked with.

To use: Compile and run WordSearch.java; interactions will take place via console.



Instructions: "Create a program that takes in a certain number of words from the user and
generates a word search using those words. Initially, your program should display an intro to
the user describing what the program does. There should then be options for the user to select
by typing in a letter. The user should be able to perform several actions during one run of your
program."
